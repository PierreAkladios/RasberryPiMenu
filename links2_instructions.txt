    Using the <Up_Arrow> key while the "Go to box" is active permits scrolling of this session's "Go to" history (i.e. all the urls/filenames you typed in).

    Links will also automatically prepend any request with the protocol prefix (http://; file://; ftp://) according to the scheme explained in [Note 1].
